# CCredit Card Approvals Analysis

Welcome to the repository for the Credit Card Approvals Analysis. This project is designed to delve into credit card application data, applying data preprocessing techniques, visualization, and machine learning models to understand and predict approval outcomes.

Project Overview
Credit card approval is influenced by various factors such as credit history, loan amounts, and personal details. This notebook analyzes these factors to predict the likelihood of approval based on applicant data.

Contents
creditcard_approvals.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook containing all the analysis, visualizations, and predictive modeling.

Tools and Technologies
Python: The primary programming language used.
Jupyter: An open-source software that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.
Libraries:
pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.
scikit-learn for machine learning.

Installation
To run this notebook, you will need to install Python and the necessary libraries. Below is an example of how you can set up your environment:


# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/creditcard_approvals.git
cd creditcard_approvals

# Optional: Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install notebook pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
